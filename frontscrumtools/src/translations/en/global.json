This means the team works in short, regular cycles, delivering a functional version of the product or project after each iteration.",

    "p2": "We accept that requirements change and the software must adapt accordingly.",
    "p3": "We deliver functional software on a frequent basis, with a frequency ranging from a few weeks to a few months, preferably for the shortest possible period.",
    "p4": "Business managers and developers work together on a daily basis throughout the project.",
    "p5": "We build projects around motivated individuals. We give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done.",

    "p7": "Working software is the primary measure of progress.",
    "p8": "Agile processes promote sustainable development. Sponsors, developers and users must be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.",
